# Satellite-based Emergency Mapping Analysis

## About


## Setup and Run

### Requirements

- Tested with Python 3.10 (however other versions may also work)

### Creating virtual environment and installing requirements

##### (OPTION 1) Make new pyenv virtualenv with specific name
Requirements: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
```
pyenv virtualenv 3.10 sem_analysis_venv
cd $THIS_REPO$
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### (OPTION 2 - EASIER) Make new python venv manually
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run

This isnt very organised but most code should be somewhat self-explanatory
