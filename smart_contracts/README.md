# Smart Contracts for Distributed Systems (smart-contracts)

## About

This repository holds smart contracts and scripts to test and deploy such smart contracts for varying tasks. The contracts can be combined together with inheritance or new contracts can be built from the functions that exist within.

## Notice

The smart contracts within have not been fully security tested and therefore errors, or vulnerabilities may exist. Using the code here on a distributed system is done at your own risk.

## Contracts

TBC

### Solidity (EVM Compatible)

Solidity is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatible language and also runs on other distributed systems. Solidity is somewhat similar to a stripped back version of Javascript.

### Future Languages

PyTEAL (Algorand), Vyper (EVM), Rust (Many)


## Frontend

Frontend holds interface code for connecting websites and web2 components to backend smart contracts.
