# Frontend Building Blocks for connection to Distributed Networks and Smart Contracts

The App currently in this directory is less of building blocks and more a full app. Therefore, it will be reduced slowly into a template of building blocks.

## Setup

### Setup files

`./public/data/` should include a file called `dapp-data.json` produced by the smart contract deployer for the dapp in use.

`./src/assets/` should include two image files, `social-activation-img.jpg` and `home-img.jpg`.

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run

To run for development
```
npm start
```

```
npm run build
serve -s build
```
