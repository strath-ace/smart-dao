# Review Work

1. New results are built from the jupyter notebooks.

2. Place new results in `/fed_results/` or `/results/` dir depending on result type.

3. Run `build_fed.py` to build `all_results.json` file where all results are combined into one file

4. Run `plot_fed_scenarios.py` and `plot_fed_num_clients.py` to produce graphs and latex tables.
